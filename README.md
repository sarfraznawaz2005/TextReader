# TextReader

TextReader is a lightweight and customizable rich text reader application built using AutoHotkey. It provides a user-friendly interface for viewing and interacting with rich text files saved in specific folder. This app loads all rich text files from specified folder.

I built this app for personal needs as my desktop was becoming a mess due to various text files. No more text files and mess on my desktop!
